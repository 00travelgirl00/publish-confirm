Extra confirmation dialogue for the publish button to avoid accidental publishing.


## Description ##
Accidentally published a WordPress post too early once too often, instead of saving it as a draft? This lightweight WordPress plugin implements an extra confirmation dialogue between your click on the *Publish* button and its actual processing. Simple and effective—never publish by accident again!

Once a post has been published, the confirmation dialogue will not appear anymore for that post.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##
### Does _Publish Confirm_ work for posts and pages? ###
Yes, it does.

### And Custom Post Types? ###
Yup.

### Can I exclude a custom post type from this plugin’s functionality? ###
Yes, you can via PHP filter from a custom plugin or from your theme’s functions.php:

`add_filter(
	'publish_confirm_exclude_post_types',
	function () {
		return array( 'my_excluded_cpt', 'another_excluded_cpt' );
	}
);`

### Can I include only certain post types, not all? ###
Yes, to see the confirm dialogue only when publishing a post or page, you can do:

`add_filter(
	'publish_confirm_include_post_types',
	function () {
		return array( 'post', 'page' );
	}
);`

### Is there any way to change the default dialogue message into something else? ###
The message text in the publishing dialogue can be changed via PHP filter from a custom plugin or your theme’s functions.php:

`add_filter(
    'publish_confirm_message',
    function( $msg ) {
        return "You’re about to send this out into the world.\nHave you added a kitten pic?";
    }
);`
